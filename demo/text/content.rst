Bisectors - incenter - incircle
=================================================================================

Here we will see the second of the three notable lines of a triangle: **the
bisector.**

*Bisector*
-----------

`An angle bisector is the line that divides said angle into two angles
equal.`_.

*Incenter*
----------

When we draw the three bisectors of a triangle, they always meet
intersect at one point. This point is called the `incenter`_ of the triangle.

*Inscribed circumference*
-------------------------

The circle that is tangent to all three sides of a triangle is called
`inscribed circle`_ and has as its center, the incenter of the triangle. This
means that the distance from the incenter to the nearest point of
any of the sides of the triangle is equal.

The incenter is always inside the triangle.

**All the properties mentioned here can be verified with the graph
interactive and apply to any triangle.**
